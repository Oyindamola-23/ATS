Job Matching Application Software

Purpose:

This Python application aims to streamline the recruitment process by matching job descriptions with candidate resumes using natural language processing techniques. It empowers recruiters to efficiently filter potential candidates and identify the best matches for open positions.

Key Features:

Job-Resume Matching:

Compares job descriptions with resumes to identify relevant candidates based on keyword matching and advanced text analysis techniques.
Calculates matching scores to quantify the degree of alignment between job requirements and candidate qualifications.

Text Processing Capabilities:

Leverages the Natural Language Toolkit (NLTK) to perform various text processing tasks, such as:
Tokenization: Breaking text into individual words or meaningful units for further analysis.
Part-of-speech tagging: Assigning grammatical categories to words (e.g., nouns, verbs, adjectives).
Named entity recognition: Identifying and classifying named entities in text (e.g., people, organizations, locations).
Stemming: Reducing words to their root forms for improved matching accuracy.
Sentiment analysis: Determining the overall sentiment or attitude expressed in text.

Flexible Framework:

Provides a foundation for building more comprehensive recruitment tools.
Can be extended to incorporate additional features such as:
Skills matching.
Experience matching.
Candidate ranking and prioritization.
Recommendation systems for suggesting relevant candidates.
